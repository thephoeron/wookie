Documentation
=============
Wookie's documentation is split into several parts:

- [Listeners](/wookie/listeners)<br>
  Listeners are how you start/stop a Wookie server
- [Routes](/wookie/routes)<br>
  Routes are how you tell Wookie how you want to handle certain requests
- [Plugins/Hooke](/wookie/plugins)<br>
  Plugins are a way to extend Wookie's functionality
